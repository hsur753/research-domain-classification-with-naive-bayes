1,"in a previous work all three components of comamonas testosteroni b-356 biphenyl bphchlorobiphenyls pcbs dioxygenase dox have been purified and characterized they include an iron-sulphur protein ispbph which is the terminal oxygenase composed of two subunits encoded by bpha and bphe a ferredoxin ferbph encoded by bphf and a reductase redbph encoded by bphg bphg is not located in the neighbourhood of bphaef in b-356 we are reporting the cloning of b-356-bphg and the sequencing of b-356-bph dox genes comparative analysis of the genes provided genetic evidence showing that two bph dox lineages have emerged in gram-negative bacteria the main features of the lineage that includes b-356 are the location of bphg outside the bph gene cluster and the structure of redbph which is very distinct from all other aryl dioxygenase-reductases"
2,"we compared morphology of two geographically close populations of the tropical lizard tropidurus hispidus to test the hypothesis that habitat structure influences the evolution of morphology and ecology at the population level t hispidus isolated on a rock outcrop surrounded by tropical forest use rock crevices for refuge and appear dorsoventrally compressed compared with those in open savanna a principal components analysis revealed that the populations were differentially distributed along an axis representing primarily three components of shape body width body height and hind-leg length morphological divergence was supported by a principal components analysis of size-free morphological variables mitochondrial dna sequences of atpase 6 indicate that these populations are closely related relative to other t hispidus the rock outcrop morphology and ecology are derived within t hispidus and morphological and ecological divergence has occurred more rapidly than genetic divergence this suggests that natural selection can rapidly adjust morphology and ecology in response to a recent history of exposure to habitats differing in structure a result heretofore implied from comparative studies among lizard species"
3,"factor xiii mr 320000 is a blood coagulation factor that stabilizes and strengthens the fibrin clot it circulates in blood as a tetramer composed of two a subunits mr 75000 each and two b subunits mr 80000 each the b subunit consists of 641 amino acids and includes 10 tandem repeats of 60 amino acids known as gp-i structures short consensus repeats scr or sushi domains in the present study the human gene for the b subunit has been isolated from three different genomic libraries prepared in lambda phage fifteen independent phage with inserts coding for the entire gene were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping southern blotting and dna sequencing the gene was found to be 28 kilobases in length and consisted of 12 exons i-xii separated by 11 intervening sequences the leader sequence was encoded by exon i while the carbonyl-terminal region of the protein was encoded by exon xii exons ii-xi each coded for a single sushi domain suggesting that the gene evolved through exon shuffling and duplication the 12 exons in the gene ranged in size from 64 to 222 base pairs while the introns ranged in size from 87 to 9970 nucleotides and made up 92 of the gene the introns contained four alu repetitive sequences one each in introns a e i and j a fifth alu repeat was present in the flanking 3' end of the gene two partial kpni repeats were also found in the introns including one in intron i and one in intron j the kpni repeat in intron j was 89 homologous to a sequence of approximately 2200 nucleotides flanking the gene coding for human beta globin and approximately 3800 nucleotides from the l1 insertion present in the gene for human factor viii intron h also contained an o family repeat while two potential regions for z-dna were identified within introns g and j one nucleotide change was found in the coding region of the gene when its sequence was compared to that of the cdna this difference however did not result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein"

5,"fat tissue plays a critical role in the regulation of energy metabolism here we report the proteomic identification of a novel fat tissue-specific low molecular weight protein falp which responds to insulin falp is preferentially expressed in adipocytes but not in preadipocytes as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis northern blot analysis shows that the falp gene is predominantly expressed in brown and white fat tissues but not in any other tissues examined human homologs of mouse falp are found to exist as two alternatively spliced isoforms which share the same n-terminus but have different c-termini both human and mouse falp contain a conserved putative transmembrane domain immunofluorescent analyses of 3t3-l1 adipocytes show that falp protein strictly localizes at a compact perinuclear membrane compartment treatment of cells with insulin induces the redistribution of falp into numerous discrete spotty structures spreading throughout the cytoplasm whereas the function of falp is currently unclear its tissue specific expression and the responsiveness to insulin suggest that falp might be involved in a process specifically restricted to adipose tissue function such as vesicular transport and protein secretion"
6,"mammalian cells obtain nucleic acid precursors through the de novo synthesis of nucleotides and the salvage of exogenous nucleobases and nucleosides the first step in the salvage pathway is transport across the plasma membrane several transport activities including equilibrative and concentrative mechanisms have been identified by their functional properties we report here the functional cloning of a 26-kilobase pair human cdna encoding the nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside nbmpr-insensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter ei by functional complementation of the transport deficiency in a subline of cem human leukemia cells expression of this cdna conferred an nbmpr-insensitive sodium-independent nucleoside transport activity to the cells that exhibited substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity characteristic of the ei transporter the cdna contained a single open reading frame that encoded a 456-residue protein with 11 potential membrane-spanning regions and two consensus sites for n-glycosylation in the first predicted extracellular loop the predicted protein was 50 identical to the recently cloned human nbmpr-sensitive equilibrative nucleoside transporter ent1 and thus was designated ent2 surprisingly the carboxyl-terminal portion of the ent2 protein was nearly identical to a smaller protein in the genbanktm data base human hnp36 326 residues that has been identified as a growth factor-induced delayed early response gene of unknown function comparison of the ent2 and hnp36 nucleotide sequences suggested that hnp36 was translated from a second start codon within the ent2 open reading frame transient expression studies with the full-length ent2 and a 5'-truncated construct that lacks the first start codon predicted protein 99 identical to hnp36 demonstrated that only the full-length construct conferred uridine transport activity to the cells these data suggest that the delayed early response gene hnp36 is a truncated form of ent2 and that the full-length open reading frame of ent2 is required for production of a functional plasma membrane ei transporter"
7,"a characteristic feature of early zygote development in chlamydomonas is the selective degradation of chloroplast dna from the mating type minus parent the zygote-specific gene cluster ezy-1 is linked to the mating type locus and is transcribed almost immediately upon zygote formation we show here that the acidic ezy-1 polypeptide is rapidly transported to both the plus and minus chloroplasts where it interacts with each chloroplast nucleoid expression of ezy-1 is selectively inhibited when plus but not minus gametes are briefly ultraviolet irradiated just prior to mating a treatment known to disrupt the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits we propose that the ezy-1 polypeptide participates in the destruction of the minus chloroplast dna in zygotes and thus the uniparental inheritance of chloroplast traits the ezy-1 gene represents a valuable molecular probe for dissecting mechanisms underlying organelle inheritance"

38,"adp-ribosylation factors arfs have been implicated in vesicle transport in the golgi complex employing yeast two-hybrid screening of an hl60 cdna library using a constitutively active mutant of arf3 arf3q71l as a probe we have identified a cdna encoding a novel protein with a calculated molecular mass of 386 kda which we have named arfaptin 1 the mrna of arfaptin 1 was ubiquitously expressed and recombinant arfaptin 1 bound preferentially to class i arfs especially arf1 but only in the gtp-bound form the interactions were independent of myristoylation of arf arfaptin 1 in cytosol was recruited to golgi membranes by arf in a guanosine 5'-o-3-thiotriphosphate-dependent and brefeldin a-sensitive manner when expressed in cos cells arfaptin 1 was localized to the golgi complex the yeast two-hybrid system yielded another clone which encoded a putative protein which we have named arfaptin 2 this consisted of the same number of amino acids as arfaptin 1 and was 60 identical to it arfaptin 2 was also ubiquitously expressed and bound to the gtp- but not gdp-liganded form of class i arfs especially arf1 these results suggest that arfaptins 1 and 2 may be direct target proteins of class 1 arfs arfaptin 1 may be involved in golgi function along with arf1"
39,"helicobacter pylori one of the most common bacterial pathogens of humans colonizes the gastric mucosa where it appears to persist throughout the host's life unless the patient is treated colonization induces chronic gastric inflammation which can progress to a variety of diseases ranging in severity from superficial gastritis and peptic ulcer to gastric cancer and mucosal-associated lymphoma strain-specific genetic diversity has been proposed to be involved in the organism's ability to cause different diseases or even be beneficial to the infected host and to participate in the lifelong chronicity of infection here we compare the complete genomic sequences of two unrelated h pylori isolates this is to our knowledge the first such genomic comparison h pylori was believed to exhibit a large degree of genomic and allelic diversity but we find that the overall genomic organization gene order and predicted proteomes sets of proteins encoded by the genomes of the two strains are quite similar between 6 to 7 of the genes are specific to each strain with almost half of these genes being clustered in a single hypervariable region"
40,"nucleotide sequences for the three exons of the beta2-microglobulin beta2m gene b2m were determined for 135 animals representing 37 species and all 16 genera of neotropical primates platyrrhini twenty-eight different nucleotide sequences encoding for 26 different proteins were obtained in comparison with those of other primate species the beta2-microglobulins of the platyrrhini form a distinct clade individual genera of neotropical primates have distinctive b2m sequences but within a genera species can have either the same or different b2m sequences b2m polymorphism was found within three of the species sampled callicebus personatus saguinus midas and aotus azarae of these only the polymorphism in a azarae has an effect upon the mature functional beta2m protein residue 4 being either alanine or threonine the a azarae b2m allele encoding alanine at position 4 is shared with another species of aotus a infulatus in pairwise comparison the mature beta2m proteins of neotropical primates differ by 1-9 amino acid substitutions which can occur at 18 positions within the sequence the substitutions are distributed throughout the primary structure but are more commonly found in loops rather than beta strands of the tertiary structure of 17 residues of beta2m which hydrogen-bond with the class i heavy chain in human mhc class i molecules 13 are conserved in the neotropical primates the overall pattern of sequence variation in the b2m genes of the platyrrhini is consistent with an evolution by successive selectively neutral events"
41,"the bcl-2 family of proteins consists of both antagonists eg bcl-2 and agonists eg bax that regulate apoptosis and compete through dimerization the bh1 and bh2 domains of bcl-2 are required to heterodimerize with bax and to repress cell death conversely the bh3 domain of bax is required to heterodimerize with bcl-2 and to promote cell death to extend this pathway we used interactive cloning to identify bid which encodes a novel death agonist that heterodimerizes with either agonists bax or antagonists bcl-2 bid possesses only the bh3 domain lacks a carboxy-terminal signal-anchor segment and is found in both cytosolic and membrane locations bid counters the protective effect of bcl-2 moreover expression of bid without another death stimulus induces ice-like proteases and apoptosis mutagenesis revealed that an intact bh3 domain of bid was required to bind the bh1 domain of either bcl-2 or bax a bh3 mutant of bid that still heterodimerized with bcl-2 failed to promote apoptosis dissociating these activities in contrast the only bid bh3 mutant that retained death promoting activity interacted with bax but not bcl-2 this bh3-only molecule supports bh3 as a death domain and favors a model in which bid represents a death ligand for the membrane-bound receptor bax"

162,"ctpphosphocholine cytidylyltransferase cct is a key regulator of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and only a single isoform of this enzyme cctalpha is known we identified and sequenced a human cdna that encoded a distinct cct isoform called cctbeta that is derived from a gene different from that encoding cctalpha cctbeta transcripts were detected in human adult and fetal tissues and very high transcript levels were found in placenta and testis cctbeta and cctalpha proteins share highly related but not identical catalytic domains followed by three amphipathic helical repeats like cctalpha cctbeta required the presence of lipid regulators for maximum catalytic activity the amino terminus of cctbeta bears no resemblance to the amino terminus of cctalpha and cctbeta protein was localized to the cytoplasm as detected by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy whereas cctalpha activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation cctbeta lacks most of the corresponding carboxyl-terminal domain and contained only 3 potential phosphorylation sites of the 16 identified in cctalpha transfection of cos-7 cells with a cctbeta expression construct led to the overexpression of cct activity the accumulation of cellular cdp-choline and enhanced radiolabeling of phosphatidylcholine cctbeta protein was posttranslationally modified in cos-7 cells resulting in slower migration during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis expression of cctbetacctalpha chimeric proteins showed that the amino-terminal portion of cctbeta was required for posttranslational modification these data demonstrate that a second distinct cct enzyme is expressed in human tissues and provides another mechanism by which cells regulate phosphatidylcholine production"
163,"pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infections a major factor in its prominence as a pathogen is its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and disinfectants here we report the complete sequence of p aeruginosa strain pao1 at 63 million base pairs this is the largest bacterial genome sequenced and the sequence provides insights into the basis of the versatility and intrinsic drug resistance of p aeruginosa consistent with its larger genome size and environmental adaptability p aeruginosa contains the highest proportion of regulatory genes observed for a bacterial genome and a large number of genes involved in the catabolism transport and efflux of organic compounds as well as four potential chemotaxis systems we propose that the size and complexity of the p aeruginosa genome reflect an evolutionary adaptation permitting it to thrive in diverse environments and resist the effects of a variety of antimicrobial substances"

168,"variation in rates of molecular evolution now appears to be widespread the demonstration that body size is correlated with rates of molecular evolution suggests that physiological and ecological factors may be involved in molecular rate variation but large-scale comparative studies are still lacking here we use complete cytochrome b sequences from 85 species of tube-nosed seabirds order procellariiformes and 5 outgroup species of penguins order sphenisciformes to test for an association between body mass and rates of molecular evolution within the former avian order cladistic analysis of the 90 sequences estimates a phylogeny largely consistent with the traditional taxonomy of the procellariiformes the diomedeidae procellariidae and pelecanoididae are monophyletic while the hydrobatidae are basal and paraphyletic however the two subfamilies within the hydrobatidae hydrobatinae and oceanitinae are monophyletic a likelihood ratio test detects significant deviation from clocklike evolution in our data using a sign test for an association between body mass and branch length in the seabird phylogeny we find that larger taxa tend to have shorter terminal branch lengths than smaller taxa this observation suggests that rates of mitochondrial dna evolution are slower for larger taxa rate calibrations based on the fossil record reveal concordant body size effects we interpret these results as evidence for a metabolic rate effect as the species in this order exhibit large differences in metabolic rates which are known to be highly correlated with body mass in this group our results support previous findings of body size effects and show that this effect can be significant even within a single avian order this suggests that even lineage-specific molecular clocks may not be tenable if calibrations involve taxa with different metabolic rates"

379,"the complete nucleotide sequence of clostridium botulinum type d strain cb16 neurotoxin was determined and the deduced amino acid sequence is reported here for the first time the structure and function of botulinum type d neurotoxin is discussed from a molecular biological viewpoint dna was extracted from toxin-converting phage d-16 phi of c botulinum type d strain cb16 and a fragment about 10 kbp coding for the neurotoxin was cloned into escherichia coli using lambda gt11 a 21-mer oligonucleotide which corresponds to phe7 to val13 of the partial amino acid sequence near the n-terminus of the type d neurotoxin was synthesized and used as a probe to identify the gene encoding type d neurotoxin the nucleotide sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for 1275 amino acids molecular weight of 146785 and the deduced amino acid sequence corresponded exactly to the partial amino acid sequences determined by direct microsequencing of the neurotoxin fragments in the dichain molecule of the neurotoxin thr2 and asn443 formed the n-termini of the light chain mw 50410 and heavy chain mw 96394 respectively and these two chains were linked with a disulfide bond between cys437 on the light chain and cys450 on the heavy chain the nucleotide sequence of the d-cb16 neurotoxin differed from that previously reported for type d neurotoxin by three nucleotides"
380,"the hsp70dnak locus of the moderate thermophilic archaeon methanosarcina thermophila tm-1 was cloned sequenced and tested in vitro to measure gene induction by heat and ammonia ie stressors pertinent to the biotechnological ecosystem of this methanogen that plays a key role in anaerobic bioconversions the locus' genes and organization 5'-grpe-hsp70dnak-hsp40 dnaj-trka-3' are the same as those of the closely related mesophile methanosarcina mazei s-6 but different from those of the only other archaeon for which comparable sequence data exist the thermophile methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum deltah from another genus in which trka is not part of the locus the proteins encoded in the tm-1 genes are very similar to the s-6 homologs but considerably less similar to the deltah proteins the tm-1 hsp70dnak protein has the 23-amino acid deletion--by comparison with homologs from gram-negative bacteria first described in the s-6 molecule and later found to be present in all homologs from archaea and gram positives the genes responded to a temperature elevation in a manner that demonstrated that they are heat-shock genes functionally active in vivo ammonia also induced a heat-shock type of response by hsp70dnak and a similar response by trka the data suggest that the moderate thermophile tm-1 has an active hsp70dnak-chaperone machine in contrast to hyperthermophilic archaea and that trka is a stress gene inasmuch as it responds like classic heat-shock genes to stressors that induce a typical heat-shock response"
381,"the complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast genome 150613 bp from the unicellular green alga chlorella vulgaris c-27 has been determined the genome contains no large inverted repeat and has one copy of rrna gene cluster consisting of 16s 23s and 5s rrna genes it contains 31 trna genes of which the trnaleugag gene has not been found in land plant chloroplast dnas analyzed so far sixty-nine protein genes and eight orfs conserved with those found in land plant chloroplasts have also been found the most striking is the existence of two adjacent genes homologous to bacterial genes involved in cell division mind and mine which are arranged in the same order in escherichia coli this finding suggests that the mechanism of chloroplast division is similar to bacterial division other than mind and mine homologues genes encoding ribosomal proteins l5 l12 l19 and s9 rpl5 rpl12 rpl19 and rps9 a chlorophyll biosynthesis mg chelating subunit chli and elongation factor ef-tu tufa which have not been reported from land plant chloroplast dnas are present in this genome however many of the new chloroplast genes recently found in red and brown algae have not been found in c vulgaris furthermore this algal species possesses two long orfs related to ycf1 and ycf2 that are exclusively found in land plants these observations suggest that c vulgaris is closer to land plants than to red and brown algae"
382,"we have determined the nucleotide sequences of the genes encoding the fimbrial subunits representative of the known bacteroides nodosus serogroups all of the genes are preceded by a highly conserved region which includes the likely promoter and transcriptional regulator sites as well as the ribosome-biding site and are followed within a short but variable distance by a sequence with the characteristics of a transcription termination or attenuation signal based on sequence and organization the subunits can be divided into two major classes called i serogroups a b c e f g and i and ii serogroups d and h all contain the same seven-amino-acid positively charged leader sequence and conserved hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence typical of type 4 fibriae beyond this point the class ii subunits are quite different from class i and share features more in common with those from other type 4 fimbriate bacteria such as moraxella bovis and pseudomonas aeruginosa the larger class i may be further subdivided into two subsets i a e fb i and ii c g these proteins exhibit three major clusters of variation at either end of the presumptive disulphide loop which spans the central third of the protein and near the carboxy-terimus with dispersed changes in between the length of the mature subunits varies from 152-156 amino acids and the variation includes small insertions or deletions in the variable clusters between more conserved domains the class ii subunits are 149 amino acids in length and contain two pairs of cysteine residues one is at the end of the amino-terminal conserved region and the other is at the end of the protein the major variation occurs in the central region of the molecule and again small insertions or deletions are required to align adjacent conserved domains there is also a striking absence of silent codon changes in the 5' coding region of all of these genes indicating that these sequences have a secondary genetic function probably in recombinational exchange"
383,"variation in rates of molecular evolution now appears to be widespread the demonstration that body size is correlated with rates of molecular evolution suggests that physiological and ecological factors may be involved in molecular rate variation but large-scale comparative studies are still lacking here we use complete cytochrome b sequences from 85 species of tube-nosed seabirds order procellariiformes and 5 outgroup species of penguins order sphenisciformes to test for an association between body mass and rates of molecular evolution within the former avian order cladistic analysis of the 90 sequences estimates a phylogeny largely consistent with the traditional taxonomy of the procellariiformes the diomedeidae procellariidae and pelecanoididae are monophyletic while the hydrobatidae are basal and paraphyletic however the two subfamilies within the hydrobatidae hydrobatinae and oceanitinae are monophyletic a likelihood ratio test detects significant deviation from clocklike evolution in our data using a sign test for an association between body mass and branch length in the seabird phylogeny we find that larger taxa tend to have shorter terminal branch lengths than smaller taxa this observation suggests that rates of mitochondrial dna evolution are slower for larger taxa rate calibrations based on the fossil record reveal concordant body size effects we interpret these results as evidence for a metabolic rate effect as the species in this order exhibit large differences in metabolic rates which are known to be highly correlated with body mass in this group our results support previous findings of body size effects and show that this effect can be significant even within a single avian order this suggests that even lineage-specific molecular clocks may not be tenable if calibrations involve taxa with different metabolic rates"

653,"to investigate the evolutionary pressures that drive the generation of polymorphism in primate mhc class i molecules three cdna that encode mhc class i alleles from a new world monkey the cotton-top tamarin saguinus oedipus were cloned and sequenced these tamarin mhc class i alleles contained amino acid substitutions not found in any of the previously sequenced human mhc class i alleles moreover the majority of these unique amino acid substitutions was located in the ag recognition site at positions that have been shown to be critical in the presentation of viral peptides to t cells in mice and humans these data suggest that selective pressures on mhc class i molecules preferentially act on the ag recognition site and that the peptide binding or presenting functions of these molecules may drive the generation of mhc class i polymorphism the novel ag recognition sites of the tamarin mhc class i molecules in addition to their restricted polymorphism might account for the unusual susceptibility of the cotton-top tamarin to human pathogens"
654,"animal mitochondrial dna mtdna is known to contain information about the genealogical relations among closely related species and is shown here to yield information about distant relations as well our results also draw attention to the need for caution in using third positions of codons for tree construction this is evident from comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene in 13 species representing major groups within the order of perching birds passeriformes sequences of a 924 base-pair segment of this gene were obtained from each of these species via the polymerase chain reaction and a novel set of versatile primers with a woodpecker sequence as an outgroup trees that separate songbirds from other perching birds and resolve the ancient branch leading to songbirds were obtained utilizing the conservative first and second positions of codons analysis of positions within codons suggests that for deep branches the skewed base composition at the fast-changing third positions can result in phylogenetic disinformation which conflicts with the information retained in the first and second positions the mitochondrial tree shows broad concordance with that based on hybridization of nuclear dna however parsimony and maximum likelihood methods suggest a close kinship between thrushes and australian babblers in agreement with the traditional morphological classification"

910,"a cdna clone coding for a sea urchin embryonic protein was isolated from a prehatching blastula lambda gt11 library the predicted translation product is a secreted 64 x 103 mr enzyme designated as bp10 the protein contains several domains a signal peptide a putative propeptide a catalytic domain with an active center typical of a zn2-metalloprotease an egf-like domain and two internal repeats similar to repeated domains found in the c1s and c1r serine proteases of the complement cascade the bp10 protease is constructed with the same domains as the human bone morphogenetic protein bmp-1 a protease described as a factor involved in bone formation and as the recently characterized product of the tolloid gene which is required for correct dorsal-ventral patterning of the drosophila embryo the transcription of the bp10 gene is transiently activated around the 16- to 32-cell stage and the accumulation of bp10 transcripts is limited to a short period at the blastula stage by in situ hybridization with digoxygenin-labelled rna probes the bp10 transcripts were only detected in a limited area of the blastula showing that the transcription of the bp10 gene is also spatially controlled antibodies directed against a fusion protein were used to detect the bp10 protein in embryonic extracts the protein is first detected in early blastula stages its level peaks in late cleavage declines abruptly before ingression of primary mesenchyme cells and remains constant in late development the distribution of the bp10 protein during its synthesis and secretion was analysed by immunostaining blastula-stage embryos the intracellular localization of the bp10 staining varies with time the protein is first detected in a perinuclear region then in an apical and submembranous position just before its secretion into the perivitelline space the protein is synthesized in a sharply delimited continuous territory spanning about 70 of the blastula comparison of the size and orientation of the labelled territory in the late blastula with the fate map of the blastula stage embryo shows that the domain in which the bp10 gene is expressed corresponds to the presumptive ectoderm developing embryos treated with purified antibodies against the bp10 protein and with synthetic peptides derived from the egf-like domain displayed perturbations in morphogenesis and were radialized to various degrees these results are consistent with a role for bp10 in the differentiation of ectodermal lineages and subsequent patterning of the embryo on the basis of these results we speculate that the role of bp10 in the sea urchin embryo might be similar to that of tolloid in drosophila we discuss the idea that the processes of spatial regulation of gene expression along the animal-vegetal in sea urchin and dorsal-ventral axes in drosophila might have some similarities and might use common elements"

985,"the structural genes encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh 3-phosphoglycerate kinase pgk and the n-terminal part of triosephosphate isomerase tim from mesophilic bacillus megaterium dsm319 have been cloned as a gene cluster gap operon by complementation of an escherichia coli gap amber mutant subsequently the entire tpi gene encoding tim was isolated by colony hybridization using a homologous probe nucleotide nt sequence analysis revealed an unidentified open reading frame urf1 of 1029 bp located 50 nt upstream from the start codon of the gap gene gene expression from subclones containing different coding regions was studied by enzyme assay and sds-page both gapdh and tim are synthesized in transformed e coli cells whereas pgk is not there is no unequivocal evidence for urf1 expression two putative promoter sites are present one 100 nt upstream from urf1 and one 200 nt upstream from the pgk gene an inverted repeat following the second promoter site is postulated to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the operon each coding region shows a gc content of 40 attained by the adaptation of the gc content of the third base in the codon to compensate the gc content of the first and second bases the deduced amino acid aa sequences of b megaterium gapdh pgk and tim were compared with those from the thermophilic bacillus stearothermophilus by antisymmetrical matrices the detected characteristic thermophilic-mesophilic exchange pattern concerning aa substitutions between hydrophobic-polar and charged-charged residues corresponds to data obtained for thermophilic and mesophilic lactate dehydrogenases ldh the determination of the thermostability of these enzymes revealed two regions of stability for b megaterium tim at high enzyme concentrations heat treatment seems to be responsible for the conversion of two differently active conformations or the induction of a new quaternary structure"
986,"the sequence of 139 kilobases kb of the 171-kb mitochondrial genome of mytilus edulis has been determined and the arrangement of all genes has been deduced mytilus mitochondrial dna mtdna contains 37 genes all of which are transcribed from the same dna strand the gene content of mytilus is typically metazoan in that it includes genes for large and small ribosomal rnas for a complete set of transfer rnas and for 12 proteins the protein genes encode the cytochrome b apoenzyme cytochrome c oxidase co subunits i-iii nadh dehydrogenase nd subunits 1-6 and 4l and atp synthetase atpase subunit 6 no gene for atpase subunit 8 could be found the reading frames for the nd1 coi and coiii genes contain long extensions relative to those genes in other metazoan mtdnas there are 23 trna genes one more than previously found in any metazoan mtdna the additional trna appears to specify methionine making mytilus mtdna unique in having two trnamet genes five lengthy unassigned intergenic sequences are present four of which vary in length from 79 to 119 nucleotides and the largest of which is 12 kb the base compositions of these are unremarkable and do not differ significantly from that of the remainder of the mtdna the arrangement of genes in mytilus mtdna is remarkably unlike that found in any other known metazoan mtdna"
